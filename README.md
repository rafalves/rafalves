### Hi, 👋 I'm Rafael Alves


- 🔭 I’m currently working as a tester on <a href="https://www.utest.com/">uTest</a>, running small e-commerce, and doing small freelancer jobs.
- 🌱 My goal is to specialize in marketing, design, and product creation for the web.
- 💻 I know about QA Manual Tests, Javascript, Node, Express, Vue, Nuxt, Strapi v4, Puppeteer, Dart, Flutter, and going on!
- 👷🏽‍♂️ My current stack are Nuxt 3, Strapi v4, and Puppeteer, later I pretend to focus on porting my project to Flutter mobile apps (I miss studying Flutter...💙). 
- ⚡ Fun fact I like to 💪🏽, 🎸, and 👨🏽‍🍳🥖.
